## Maker Comment

Hey Product Hunt, I am the maker of Chrondle. It is a daily history game where
you submit a year range, unlock up to six hints, and score by how tight the
range is. There are two modes (Classic and Order), a growing archive of 150+
puzzles, and a retro-archival visual style. Built for quick mobile play, plus
deeper dives if you want to chase perfect scores. I would love feedback on the
scoring feel and the hint pacing.
