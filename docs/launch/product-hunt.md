## Maker comment (draft)

Hi PH! I am [name], maker of Chrondle. It is a daily history puzzle where you guess the year by entering a range and tightening it as hints appear. Classic mode is about the single year; Order mode is about sequencing events on a timeline. There is a 150+ puzzle archive and it plays fast on mobile.

I would love feedback on hint fairness and scoring. What would make this a daily habit for you?

## FAQ / response templates

Q: What is Chrondle?
A: A daily history puzzle. You guess a year by entering a range that shrinks as hints unlock.

Q: How is it different from Wordle?
A: It is about timelines, not spelling. You can be close even when you are not exact.
