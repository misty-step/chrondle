Welcome to Chrondle! We're excited to launch our daily history guessing game.

In Classic mode, you'll use hints about historical events to narrow down the year something happened. The fewer hints you need and the narrower your range, the higher your score.

In Order mode, you'll arrange six historical events in chronological order - from ancient history to modern times. It's a great way to test your knowledge of how events connect across the ages.

Today's puzzle is always free. Subscribe to unlock our growing archive of 150+ puzzles spanning 5,000 years of human history.
